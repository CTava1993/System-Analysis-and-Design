~Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project (and this repository in general) is one in which I was putting together Business Documents, UML Models and overall documentation on a theoretical system for the company "DriverPass". This company wished to create a system in which they could provide services to aid their end user in becoming a licensed driver. The concept was that they wanted to reduce the failure rate of those taking driving exams for a license.


~What did you do particularly well?

Organization and concise approaches to my work. I tend to lean towards a style of work that tries to simplify things as much as possible without detracting from a level of intricacy needed to reach the given goal.


~If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

A lot, frankly. Most of the information given to me for the project never gave me solid lines on how to address any specific piece of this project to a professional level. It felt like a lot of this was a shot in the dark that I tried my best to look as business oriented and professional as I could reasonably do.


~How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We were given a transcript that had a conversation between the company we were under and DriverPass. This conversation was a simulation of the DriverPass project being pitched to us and how we would implement that design. This being said, that information allowed me to be able to draft the many requirements and parameters. This is important since ultimately this project simulated speaking to a client to design something for them. In short, I would be providing a service to another company.


~How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I personally approach software design similarly to how I design a lot of things. I emphasize not overcomplicating things, design a basis for the end result, then add on ass needed. It's important to design that product with future-proofing in mind as well. Things change over time, so you need to adapt as those needs for change arrive. Such is the mantra of IT work.
